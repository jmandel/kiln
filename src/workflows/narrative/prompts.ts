Background:
<sketch>${sketch}</sketch>

Expand plausibly: Infer patient demographics, history, symptoms, and risks from the sketch (e.g., for "52F with chest pain", assume middle-aged female with possible cardiac issues; add realistic details like onset, severity). Do not add unrelated elements—stay grounded in the sketch. Aim for 4-8 sections in logical order (e.g., Chief Complaint → HPI → PMH → Exam → Assessment → Plan). For each section, provide a one-paragraph brief as a guiding vision: Expand the brief with plausible, evidence-based details to make it vivid and realistic, not just a summary.

  "guidance": "Overall note vision: 1-2 paragraphs on tone, key themes, and expansions (e.g., 'Emphasize cardiovascular synthesis; expand history with typical comorbidities like hypertension.')"
