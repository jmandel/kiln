He describes the onset as subtle during an outdoor street performance, initially noticing difficulty raising his left eyebrow and subtle asymmetry in his smile while attempting to convey emotions to passersby. Over the subsequent hours, this progressed to noticeable drooping of the left corner of his mouth, inability to fully close his left eye, and a sensation of heaviness on the left side of his face. He reports no preceding viral illness, ear pain, or trauma, though he mentions recent exposure to variable weather during performances in urban parks. The weakness is isolated to the face, with no associated limb weakness, sensory changes, or speech difficulties beyond the facial asymmetry. His wife notes that he has been attempting to communicate non-verbally at home, but the impaired expressions have led to frustration and mild sleep disruption due to eye irritation from incomplete closure. He denies headache, vision changes, or other neurological symptoms.</div>",

He lives with his wife in a suburban home, denies alcohol or tobacco use, and exercises moderately through daily walks and performance rehearsals.

The diagnosis is supported by the lower motor neuron pattern on exam, absence of other neurological deficits, and lack of vesicles or trauma suggesting alternative etiologies like Ramsay Hunt syndrome or stroke. Differentials include Lyme disease given outdoor exposures in endemic areas, though no tick bite or systemic symptoms; sarcoidosis or malignancy are less likely in this age group without comorbidities. His hypertension is a minor risk factor for vascular events, but the isolated presentation favors idiopathic neuritis. Occupational repetitive strain may contribute to nerve vulnerability, underscoring the ironic impact on his mime career reliant on facial expressivity. Early intervention is key, as evidence supports improved recovery with steroids in adults over 40.</div>",
