Building on this, she denies similar episodes in the past but acknowledges a gradual decline in her stamina over the last year, which she attributes to \"the toll o' too many storms weathered.\" This exertional pattern is consistent with angina, prompting a deeper exploration of her cardiovascular risk factors.</div>",

Additionally, she has a history of osteoarthritis in her knees from years of \"deck-swabbin' and cannon-haulin',\" treated with over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen as needed. These comorbidities ground her current symptoms in a realistic geriatric cardiology profile, where hypertension and prior smoking synergistically elevate her risk for coronary artery disease, as evidenced by Framingham risk scoring estimating a 10-year cardiovascular event risk exceeding 20% given her age, sex, hypertension, and smoking history.</div>",

Her diet, heavy on salted fish and hearty stews reminiscent of shipboard fare, likely contributes to her sodium intake and hypertension, while her remote smoking cessation underscores a commitment to health amid a history of tobacco exposure from \"pipe-weedin' with the crew.\" She denies alcohol use beyond occasional \"grog\" and lives independently without home support, fostering a holistic view of how her seafaring background influences cardiac health through both protective physical activity and risk-laden habits like irregular meals and past nicotine dependence.

She reports mild dyspnea on exertion but denies orthopnea, palpitations, or edema; gastrointestinal review is negative for reflux or dyspepsia that might mimic cardiac symptoms; and she notes occasional arthritic joint pains without swelling. Neurologically, she denies dizziness or syncope, and her general review is otherwise unremarkable, with no fevers, weight loss, or constitutional symptoms.

Her exertional, substernal pain with radiation and relief on rest aligns with classic ischemic symptoms, without evidence of unstable features such as rest pain or hemodynamic instability. Comorbid osteoarthritis may contribute to deconditioning, exacerbating symptoms, while her seafaring lifestyle promotes resilience but underscores the impact of historical exposures like tobacco on endothelial health.
