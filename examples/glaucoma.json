He was initially diagnosed during a routine optometric exam when elevated IOP was noted bilaterally, prompting initiation of topical therapy. He has been compliant with his regimen of latanoprost 0.005% one drop nightly in both eyes (OU) and Cosopt (dorzolamide-timolol) one drop twice daily (BID) OU, reporting excellent tolerance with only occasional transient stinging upon instillation, a common side effect that resolves quickly. There have been no reports of blurred vision, halos, or progression of visual field defects since his last visit. He denies any recent trauma, infections, or changes in systemic health that might impact his ocular condition. Building on this stability, his follow-up aligns with standard monitoring intervals of every 3-6 months for POAG to prevent progression, particularly given his age and comorbidities.</p></div>",
